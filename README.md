The requirements for the test project are:

Write a simple expenses tracker application

* User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
* When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete expenses he entered.
* Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
* When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment.
* User can filter expenses.
* User can print expenses per week with the total amount and average daily spending.
* Create a chart with all expenses over time
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
* In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
* All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this).
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked on graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
* Write unit and e2e tests.
* Note: Please note that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills. The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a customer. We expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.

Please use this private repository to version-control your code (you should be able to access it using your existing credentials):
git@git.toptal.com:widovic/project-2-robin-pham.git

The project deadline is up to 2 weeks, but we do encourage you to schedule a time now. Once you schedule a call, we will email you the meeting details, and you will get a technical interviewer assigned. This technical interviewer will be able to answer any questions you might have.
